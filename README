i.MX Android BSP Repo Manifest README

This repo is used to download manifests for i.MX Android BSP releases.

The imx-android-12 branch will include all release manifests for Android 12 i.MX releases.
The code is not distributed as patches as previous i.MX Android releases.
Instead the i.MX Android open source is distributed on the https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx
and the proprietary is distributed on nxp.com.   Please download from nxp.com first the proprietary
release and follow the README directions for configuring.  Below are directions for preparation.

To use this manifest repo, the 'repo' tool must be isntalled first.
--------------------------------------------------------
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo  > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

Get the proprietary tarball from nxp.com and setup build:
-----------------------------------------
For imx-android-12.0.0_1.0.0.tar.gz          - Download imx-android-12.0.0_1.0.0.tar.gz from nxp.com.

- unzip the package
- Run the build setup script in the tarball as specified in the README - example below
- This donwloads the public Android open source and copies the proprietary to the appropriate locations

Example below
$: tar xvf imx-android-12.0.0_1.0.0.tar.gz
$: source ./imx-android-12.0.0_1.0.0/imx_android_setup.sh

Setup build environment:
-------------------------
- Set up the environment for building. This only configures the current terminal.
$ source build/envsetup.sh

- Execute the Android lunch command.
lunch command can be issued with an argument <Build name>-<Build type> or can be issued without the argument presenting a menu of selection.
$ lunch <Build name>-<Build type>
(Example: Build name :mek_8q Build type: userdebug)
Check Android User's Guide for more details

- Execute the "imx-make.sh" script to generate the image.
$ ./imx-make.sh -j4 2>&1 | tee build-log.txt
When the make command is complete, the build-log.txt file contains the execution output. Check for any errors.
