-----------------------------------------
Note: The remaining instructions are for setting up a BSP release only. For setting
up a demo, please see imx-manifest/README-<demo> for further instructions.

$: [MACHINE=<machine>] [DISTRO=fsl-imx-<backend>] source ./imx-setup-release.sh -b bld-<backend>

<machine> defaults to imx6qsabresd

<backend>   Graphics backend type
xwayland    Wayland with X11 support - default distro
wayland     Wayland
fb          Framebuffer (not supported for mx8)

Note if the poky community distro is used then build breaks will happen with some
components using our meta-fsl-bsp-release layer.

Examples:
- Setup for XWayland.
$: MACHINE=imx8mnevk DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland source ./imx-setup-release.sh -b bld-xwayland
