=== Notes on using Mender on i.MX BSP
=====================================

Mender.io is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded
Linux devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as
well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.

Mender aims to address this challenge with a robust and easy to use updater
for embedded Linux devices, which is open source and available to anyone.

Robustness is ensured with atomic image-based deployments using a dual A/B
rootfs partition layout. This makes it always possible to roll back to a
working state, even when losing power at any time during the update process.

Mender.io also supports partial update, utilizing the Update Modules feature.
An Update Module is an extension to the Mender client for supporting a new type
of software update, such as a package manager, container, bootloader or
even updates of nearby microcontrollers. An Update Module can be tailored to a
specific device or environment (e.g. update a proprietary bootloader), or be
more general-purpose (e.g. install a set of .deb packages.).

The official documentation is a good resource to get an more in depth
understanding of how Mender works:

There is a demo manifest file provided for the 'imx8mqevk' board where Mender is
integrated.

Setup environment and start a build
-----------------------------------

To use the demo manifest, the 'repo' tool must be installed first.

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo  > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin

With the 'repo' tool installed you can proceed with the following,

$: repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest -b imx-linux-sumo -m imx-4.14.98-2.0.0_demo_mender.xml
$: repo sync
$: DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland MACHINE=imx8mqevk . fsl-setup-mender.sh -b build
$: bitbake core-image-base
